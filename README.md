#### About Creating a Git repository  
Spell commands are typically run within a Git repository, but do not need to be. If you are not within a Git repository, Spell will ask you to confirm that you want to proceed since no files from your local computer will be transferred to Spell for the run. Type `y` to continue with the run.  

If a run is initiated within a Git repository, Spell will fail if the repository has **uncommitted** changes. Untracked changes will cause a warning, but you will still be allowed to proceed with your run.
